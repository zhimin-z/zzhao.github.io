Blockchain, the core component of Bitcoin, has been extremely popular among the finance, supply chain and many other industries in the last few years. Many governments and companies are experimenting blockchain with proof of concepts. The growing interest in blockchain drives a lot of new security research areas, including security model and analysis of blockchain, consensus algorithms built from cryptographic primitives, privacy enhancing technologies in blockchain (e.g. linkable ring signatures, zk-SNARKs), etc. There are still some gap between the research community and the blockchain applications. In this talk, we will introduce some challenges we faced, such as implementation difficulties, research problems and application level challenges. We present our views and some solutions on these issues.
