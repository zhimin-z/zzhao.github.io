[This course](https://h5.clewm.net/?url=h.qr61.cn%2FowzFKN%2FqoqjgmW&hasredirect=1&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) aims to fully explore its current research direction by giving students a deep understanding of the key methods of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning. First, discuss its key classification algorithms in a strictly defined classification problem to achieve the goal of perfectly combining artificial intelligence with machine learning. Then we will explore in depth 1) the technology of high-dimensional data; 2) different clustering technologies 3) the processing method of regression technology, which is used to analyze the technology based on hidden Markov model and Markov decision process. Finally, students and professors will discuss in areas such as neural networks, automatic coding, and reinforcement learning. At the end of the topic, they will review the impact of artificial intelligence on social and human development.
