This [course](https://h5.clewm.net/?url=h.qr61.cn%2FowzFKN%2FqoqjgmW&hasredirect=1&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) aims to fully explore a deep understanding of the key methods of artificial intelligence and machine learning. First, Students would master key classification models to achieve the common goal of machine learning. Then we will explore in depth 1) high-dimensional data visualization; 2) clustering techniques 3) regression analysis. Finally, we will discuss the recent advance in research areas such as neural networks, automatic coding, and reinforcement learning. At the end of the topic, they will review the impact of artificial intelligence on social and human development.
