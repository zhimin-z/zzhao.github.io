This two-week [seminar](https://www.cetustalk.com/beijingtisheng/39.html) intends to teach students the analysis of multimodal communication. Students would master the cutting-edge toolkit to analyze the sound, pictures, expressions and other factors in multimodal media. Then they would apply what they learn to multiple datasets for detailed analysis. Finally, we encourage students to participate in the rich research areas of detecting and identifying communication behaviors.
