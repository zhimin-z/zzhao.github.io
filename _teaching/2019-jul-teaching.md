[This course](https://www.cetustalk.com/beijingtisheng/39.html) intends to teach students the analysis of multimodal communication. Students would master the cutting-edge toolkit to analyze the sound, pictures, expressions and other factors in multimodal media. We will go over a series of multimodal projects by renowned institutions including Parser, SyntaxNet, FrameNet, and Semafor, etc. Finally, we encourage students to participate in the rich research areas of artificial intelligence in detecting and identifying communication behaviors.
